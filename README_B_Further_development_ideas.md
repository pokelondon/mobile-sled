###development suggestions

––Securing the rubberband__
currently we recomend gluing the rubber band to one of the leaves to assist in wrapping it round all the leaves. a physical solution would be preferable. 

––Self centering__
the use of an internal cog mechanism would allow the side leaves to self centre. 

––Laser cutting__
The sled would be far quicker to manufacture were it lasercut from acrylic, however assembely would be more complex.
