# Instructions

The STL files have been separated into groups suitable for smaller 3D printing platterns. If your pattern is larger of course feel free to combine them. 

The side and end expansion leaves include extension modules that can be added to enclose the sled more elegantly. They are only really cosmetic so can be omitted if a bit fiddly.

The eyelets for the cable ties can tricky to dig out after printing. if your printer supports more than one filament and is compatible with rinse-away support material it will make life a bit easier.

We used some foam padding within the sled walls to hold the phone more securely and prevent scratching. you can use draft excluder for this although it will need cutting down to width. We managed to find some speaker foam sealing tape on Amazon that is the perfect size (see parts list below).

The rubber band sits within it’s recessed channel and holds the phone securely. When using larger phones such as the iPhone6+ (largest catered for) it is easier to remove the rubber band first. However it can then be a bit tricky putting it back on again. We found that gluing the band (just one spot) to the bottom leaf by the cable really helps with this.

The back of the sled has been designed to attach to the HUE web cam and Amazon basics extension cable specifically.
